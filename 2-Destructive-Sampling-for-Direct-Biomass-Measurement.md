Destructive sampling is a direct approach to measuring biomass by harvesting and weighing samples from the bamboo plantation. Here’s a step-by-step guide with examples for conducting effective destructive sampling:

#### Step 1: Select Sample Plots
- Objective: To representatively cover the diversity of the plantation.
- Method: Divide the bamboo field into different sample plots. Select plots based on criteria such as age of bamboo clumps, soil type, or other visible variations in growth. Each plot should contain a small number of bamboo clumps to ensure that sampling does not overly impact the plantation.

#### Step 2: Choose Representative Culms
- Objective: To sample bamboo culms from each age group and size class.
- Example: If the plantation has culms of different ages (e.g., 1, 2, and 3 years old), select a few culms from each age group. Measure the height and diameter of each selected culm before cutting, as these measurements can help correlate size with biomass.
- Method: In each plot, randomly choose a number of culms across age classes (e.g., two culms per age class). Ensure that culms are fully grown and representative of the plantation’s diversity.

#### Step 3: Harvest the Culms
- Objective: To separate the above-ground parts (culm, branches, and leaves).
- Procedure: Carefully cut down the selected bamboo culms and separate them into components:
 - Culm (stem): The main stalk, which is the largest contributor to biomass.
 - Branches: The smaller stalks connected to the main culm.
 - Leaves: The foliage of the bamboo.

#### Step 4: Weigh Fresh Biomass
- Objective: To get the initial weight of the harvested components.
- Procedure: Weigh each component (culm, branches, leaves) immediately after harvesting to record fresh biomass. Use a portable scale with a high weight capacity for accurate measurements in the field.
- Example: For each sampled culm, record fresh weights for the culm, branches, and leaves separately, as follows:
 - Culm: 15 kg
 - Branches: 5 kg
 - Leaves: 2 kg

#### Step 5: Dry the Samples
- Objective: To measure dry biomass, which provides a more consistent value by removing moisture variability.
- Procedure:
 1. Transport samples to a drying facility or lab.
 2. Use an oven to dry each component at a consistent temperature (typically 70-80°C) until they reach a constant weight, which can take several days.

- Example: After drying, the weights might reduce significantly due to moisture loss:
 - Culm: 6 kg (from 15 kg fresh)
 - Branches: 2 kg (from 5 kg fresh)
 - Leaves: 0.8 kg (from 2 kg fresh)

#### Step 6: Calculate Dry Biomass and Biomass Ratios
- Objective: To determine the biomass of each culm and extrapolate for the entire plantation.
- Procedure:
 1. Sum the dry biomass of all sampled components to get total dry biomass per culm.
 2. Calculate ratios for fresh-to-dry biomass for each component, which helps estimate biomass in future samplings without full drying.
- Example Calculation:
 - Total dry biomass for one culm: 6 kg (culm) + 2 kg (branches) + 0.8 kg (leaves) = 8.8 kg.

#### Step 7: Extrapolate Biomass for the Plantation
- Objective: To estimate total plantation biomass based on sample data.
- Method:
 1. Calculate average biomass per culm for each age group and multiply by the total number of culms in each group across the plantation.
 - Example Calculation:
  - If the average biomass per culm is 8.8 kg, and there are 1,000 culms, estimated total biomass is 8,800 kg.

#### Step 8: Repeat Periodically and Refine Models
- Conduct destructive sampling every 2-3 years or when you observe significant growth changes. Over time, you can develop biomass models based on DBH and height measurements, allowing for less frequent destructive sampling.

#### Practical Example:
Let’s say a bamboo plantation manager conducts destructive sampling on 5 sample plots, with 10 culms each from different age groups. After drying, they calculate an average dry biomass of 8.8 kg per culm. Knowing there are 2,000 culms in the plantation, they estimate the plantation’s total biomass as:

8.8 kg/culm x 2000 culms = 17,600 kg

8.8kg/culm×2000culms=17,600kg

By repeating this process every few years, the manager can monitor the plantation’s growth and adjust management practices as needed. This approach also allows them to gradually refine estimates and, ultimately, reduce the frequency of destructive sampling by relying more on correlations between biomass and DBH or height measurements.
