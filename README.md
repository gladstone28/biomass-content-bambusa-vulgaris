To monitor the biomass content of the Bambusa vulgaris bamboo field, the plantation manager should consider the following tests and methods, ideally at regular intervals to track growth patterns effectively:

#### 1. Non-destructive Sampling for Biomass Estimation
- Test Method: Measure the height and diameter at breast height (DBH) of bamboo culms in sample plots across the field. These measurements can then be used in biomass estimation models specific to bamboo species, which typically correlate culm height and diameter with biomass.
- Frequency: Every 6-12 months to capture seasonal and annual growth changes.

#### 2. Destructive Sampling for Direct Biomass Measurement
- Test Method: Select representative culms in each age class and harvest them to measure total above-ground biomass (culm, branches, leaves). This involves drying the harvested samples and weighing them to estimate biomass. While destructive, it provides accurate data and helps validate non-destructive models.
- Frequency: Every 2-3 years, or whenever significant growth milestones are observed, to minimize impact on the plantation.

#### 3. Remote Sensing and Aerial Surveys
- Test Method: Use drones or satellite imagery equipped with multispectral or LiDAR sensors to estimate biomass on a large scale. These technologies assess canopy density, height, and other indicators of biomass without direct sampling.
- Frequency: Annually or biannually, depending on budget and growth rate, to monitor changes across the entire field.

#### 4. Soil and Nutrient Analysis
- Test Method: Collect soil samples to assess nutrient content, as soil health impacts biomass growth. Analyzing soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients provides insight into soil fertility and potential biomass yield.
- Frequency: Every 1-2 years to monitor nutrient depletion or improvement due to bamboo growth.

#### 5. Moisture Content Analysis
- Test Method: Test moisture content in culms and soil to estimate the water-related biomass variation. This requires periodic sampling of culms and soil, with drying to determine moisture percentage.
- Frequency: Every 6-12 months, especially in tropical climates with seasonal rainfall, to understand biomass variation due to moisture.

Regular monitoring with a combination of these methods can provide a comprehensive understanding of the biomass content and health of the bamboo plantation over time.
